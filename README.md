This was a Project for an AI course I took. The code itself didn't matter, only the paper we wrote and the project in general, so the code is quite... unformatted.

This was the paper I submitted: [Checkers Evolution Paper.pdf](https://github.com/matt-wats/Evolution-Checkers-6x6/files/10078011/Checkers.Evolution.Paper.pdf)

Basically, it creates a bunch of Bots (Neural Networks) that play checkers against each other, and the best ones 'evolve', in order to improve their ability to play.

Why was it played on a 6x6 board and not the usual 8x8? I have a weak computer and did not want to wait for days for it to learn. Of course if I wanted to improve on this project, optimizations are top of the list.
