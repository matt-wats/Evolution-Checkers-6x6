This was a Project for an AI course I took. The code itself didn't matter, only the paper we wrote and the project in general, so the code is quite... unformatted.

This was the paper I submitted: [Checkers Evolution Paper.pdf](https://github.com/matt-wats/Evolution-Checkers-6x6/files/10078011/Checkers.Evolution.Paper.pdf)

Basically, it creates a bunch of Bots (Neural Networks) that play checkers against each other, and the best ones 'evolve' in order to improve their ability to play.
